### Introduction

You were left in a hostile environment where you need to find supplies and survive the attacks of other desperate people like you.

You never know if the person you've found is a friend or foe, if you can talk or the only exchange will be gunfire. One mistake and you're gone.

Create a protected base, advance on the map, prepare your supplies, upgrade your equipment and arm yourself. The war is here.
